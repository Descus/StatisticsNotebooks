## 1)

### a)

The tire lifetime is supposedly more than 50.000km

### b)

$H_0: TireLifetime \leq 50.000km$

$H_1: TireLifetime > 50.000km$

### c)

Type-I error: Assume that the tire lifetime is less than 50.000km even it is more.

Type-II error: Assume that the tire lifetime is more than 50.000km even though it's not.

### d)

A significance level of 10% means:
we have a 10% Chance of getting a Type-I error
